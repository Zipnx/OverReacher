## Inputs:
- [ ] Input for limiting volume of requests per second
- [ ] Instead of executing an attack, parse another attack's output JSON

## Functionality:
- [ ] Make the attacks customizable again, this new system is way more appropriate for it
- [ ] Verify output json schema before parsing (also on custom attacks, when reimplemented)
- [ ] A config file in the proj directory that sets default options
- [ ] Maybe an option to keep track of the last scan results (in config)
- [x] Forgot the HTTP headers at the arg parsing

## Eye Candy (using rich):

# Bugs:
