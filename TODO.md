# TODO: 

## Inputs:
- [ ] Input for limiting volume of requests per second
- [ ] Instead of executing an attack, parse another attack's output JSON

## Functionality:
- [ ] Make the attacks customizable again, this new system is way more appropriate for it
- [x] Save result as JSON
- [ ] Collect response time, response status code, maybe page title?

## Eye Candy (using rich):
- [ ] Possibly a minimal mode, also --no-color param and env reading
- [ ] Cluster results to an easily viewable format
- [ ] At the end display the scan duration (save it too)

# Bugs:
