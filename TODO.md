## General:
- [X] Include the data directory on the final package
- [ ] Make the config files easily modifiable (init in another directory)
- [ ] Make a script to install without pulling the package
- [ ] Fix the module script in setup.py

## Functionality:
- [ ] Maybe an option to keep track of the last scan results (in config)
- [ ] Also add in the attacks a way to customize based on the result
- [ ] Could bring back the progress bar increasing per request, but need to account for skipped requests

## Bugs:
