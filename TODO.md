## Inputs:
- [x] Request Timeout setting
- [x] Ignore where ACAC is false and add option to track it

## Functionality:
- [x] Make the attacks customizable again, this new system is way more appropriate for it
- [x] A config file in the proj directory that sets default options
- [ ] Proxies & Headers on the config file
- [ ] Maybe an option to keep track of the last scan results (in config)
- [ ] Also add in the attacks a way to customize based on the result

## Bugs:
- [x] Attacks should be loaded from the base path of the script
