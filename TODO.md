# TODO: 

## Inputs:
- [ ] Input for limiting volume of requests per second
- [ ] Instead of executing an attack, parse another attack's output JSON

## Functionality:
- [ ] Make the attacks customizable again, this new system is way more appropriate for it
- [ ] Verify output json schema before parsing (also on custom attacks, when reimplemented)
- [x] Save result as JSON
- [x] Collect response time, response status code, maybe <s>page title</s>?
- [ ] A config file in the proj directory that sets default options
- [ ] Maybe an option to keep track of the last scan results (in config)

## Eye Candy (using rich):
- [x] Possibly a minimal mode, also --no-color param and env reading
- [x] Cluster results to an easily viewable format
- [x] At the end display the scan duration (save it too)

# Bugs:
