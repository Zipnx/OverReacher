## General:
- [ ] Include the data directory on the final package
- [ ] Make the config files easily modifiable
- [ ] Make a script to install without pulling the package

- [ ] Also add in the attacks a way to customize based on the result
- [ ] Could bring back the progress bar increasing per request, but need to account for skipped requests

## Bugs:
